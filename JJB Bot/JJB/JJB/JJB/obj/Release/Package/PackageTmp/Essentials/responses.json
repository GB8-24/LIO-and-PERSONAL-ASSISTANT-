I'm a form of artificial intelligence commonly referred to as a bot. \n\nI use natural language processing (a form of machine learning) to help me understand human language. \n\nPlus, I learn from our interactions, so the more you chat with me, the better I get at understanding the nuances of human language.\n\nI'm a mix of proprietary and open source software. Natural language processing (a form of machine learning) is the magic sauce. I'm able to understand human language and learn from my experiences with you. \n\nBut, because I'm still pretty young for a bot, most of my interactions are supervised.\n\nI'm a mix of proprietary and open source software.
