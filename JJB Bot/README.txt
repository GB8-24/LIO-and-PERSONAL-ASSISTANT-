Automation System is meant to be a web/mobile application maintained by
individual home owners. The system will provide functionalities like the ability to turn
devices and appliances inside the house on and off, both remotely over the internet and
through a simple voice command when inside the house. The system may be designed
to allow owners to track information like the status of the refrigerator, moisture level
of the plants, temperature of the home environment, etc. The Home Automation
System is unique in the way that it combines the abilities and functionalities of IoT,
NLP and chat bots where the data processing takes place in a Cloud based system.
Multiple systems currently under development, focus on only one of these innovations,
failing to recognize the benefits of combining all the systems. Together the systems are
capable of functioning as a powerful virtual assistant that is powered by the home
owner’s voice, thus also adding a layer of security to the system.
